DESCRIPTION
-----------

Puli is an open-source dispatcher entirely written in python.


SYSTEM PREREQUISITES
--------------------

Currently, Puli is only supported on Linux (32 or 64 bits).

** Linux packages :**

   * mysql-devel
   * python-devel (for your version of python)

** Python 2.6+ with following modules :**

   * MySQL-python
   * python-sqlobject
   * python-tornado

** MySQL server 5.0+**


INSTALLATION
------------

#### Creation of the database

Execute the following mysql commands to create the database and the dedicated user:

    create database pulidb character set utf8;
    create user puliuser identified by 'yourpasswd';
    grant all privileges on pulidb.* to 'puliuser'@'localhost' identified by 'yourpasswd' with grant option;

#### Installation and configuration

You can copy the `octopus` folder containing all the code to wherever you like (for example `/opt/puli`) just make sure this dir is in your PYTHONPATH.

Create the folders `conf` and `logs` in the install dir.

The settings are located in the file `/opt/puli/octopus/dispatcher/settings.py`.

Please check the following settings:

* CONFDIR = /opt/puli/conf
* LOGDIR = /opt/puli/logs
* POOLS_BACKEND_TYPE = “file”
* DB_ENABLE = True
* DB_CLEAN_DATA = True

#### First launch

To launch the dispatcher, execute the following command in a shell:

    python /opt/puli/scripts/dispatcherd.py -D -C

Upon the first execution, Puli will create the appropriate tables in the database.

For the following executions, you may set these parameters in the settings file:

* POOLS_BACKEND_TYPE = “db”
* DB_ENABLE = True
* DB_CLEAN_DATA = False

These will tell Puli to init itself with the database that was previously created. 

If you want to erase the database in order to have a clean start, reset these parameters to the values in the installation section.
