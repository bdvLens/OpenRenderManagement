README for Puli
===============


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Puli consists of the core of the Puli Project.
It contains both the dispatcher and the worker code.


SYSTEM PREREQUISITES
--------------------

Currently, Puli is only supported on Linux (32 or 64 bits).

##### Linux packages :

   * mysql-devel
   * python-devel (for your version of python)

##### Python 2.6+ with following modules :

   * MySQL-python
   * python-sqlobject
   * python-tornado

##### MySQL server 5.0+


INSTALLATION
------------

#### Creation of the database

Execute the following mysql commands to create the database and the dedicated user:

    create database pulidb character set utf8;
    create user puliuser identified by 'yourpasswd';
    grant all privileges on pulidb.* to 'puliuser'@'localhost' identified by 'yourpasswd' with grant option;

#### Installation and configuration

You can copy the `octopus` folder containing all the code to wherever you like (for example `/opt/puli`) just make sure this dir is in your PYTHONPATH.

Create the folders `conf` and `logs` in the install dir.

The settings are located in the file `/opt/puli/octopus/dispatcher/settings.py`.

Please check the following settings:
```ini
CONFDIR = /opt/puli/conf
LOGDIR = /opt/puli/logs
POOLS_BACKEND_TYPE = "file"
DB_ENABLE = True
DB_CLEAN_DATA = True
```
#### First launch

To launch the dispatcher, execute the following command in a shell:

    python /opt/puli/scripts/dispatcherd.py -D -C

Upon the first execution, Puli will create the appropriate tables in the database.

For the following executions, you may set these parameters in the settings file:

```ini
POOLS_BACKEND_TYPE = "db"
DB_ENABLE = True
DB_CLEAN_DATA = False
```
These will tell Puli to init itself with the database that was previously created, and it will enable the persistence of the jobs.

If you want to erase the database in order to have a clean start, reset these parameters to the values in the installation section.


RELEASE NOTES

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

The model needs a bit of a refactoring. It has been designed several years ago to address some use-cases that are no longer relevant.
It can be more simple and straightforward than it is now.

Several aspects of the worker can be optimized (like the handling of status and completion update, and the interaction between the cmdwatcher and the process)
